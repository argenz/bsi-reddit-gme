    "[Edit Jan 2022: This was my (Francesca) first attempt at NLP, learning anything by myself and from scratch. With my current knowledge, I realize that some of the following is wrong. Word Embeddings should be mapped to a lower dimentional spaces with methods such as Word2Vec or GloVe. The following merely provides a VxD matrix of word count occurences in each document. Furthermore, numerous best practices that should be carried out were ignored due lack of knowledge and time constraints , such as proper model selection and evaluation.]\n",

    "The \"short-squeeze\": a compelling episode that took place in early 2021 involving the Reddit's subreddit r/wallstreetbets, powerful hedge funds, and previously declining stocks, amongst which special attention was given to the video game retailer Game Stop (GME). What happened exactly? In short (pardon the pun), retail investors got organised on r/wallstreetbets to mass-purchase GME and other stocks, which funds like Melvin Capital had heavily shorted. This led to an increase in share price, causing lossess to the hedge funds, which in turn bought more shares to compensate for the losses, hence driving the share price up even more. GME stock price skyrocketed from 19 USD to 347 USD in the month of January alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in identifying this phenomenon by looking at the sentiment of submissions (or posts) on r/wallstreetbets, and in asserting the extent of its relationship with the share price. Theoretically, the stock price is a represesntation of sentiment about a specific asset or company: if many people appreciate your products or believe in your vision, i.e. have positive sentiment about your company, they are likely to buy and hold your stock hence leading to an increase its price. Analysing the submissions on the subreddit is another way of obtaining such latent sentiment. Therefore, our expectations are that the sentiment of the posts and the price should follow similar trends. Given that its a concise phenomenon involving the interaction of various parties (investors, trading platforms, stock exchanges, news outlets...) we are also interested in looking at how exogenous events influenced the stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence our research questions are:  \n",
    "1. *How does the sentiment trend on r/wallstreetbets compare to GME's stock price?* \n",
    "2. *How were the sentiment and the stock price influenced by major exogenous events?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach consists in four main phases: Data Extraction, Data Exploration, Research, and Sentiment Analysis. We begin by obtianing the data necessary for the analysis from the relevant APIs; then we explore the data: we look at the daily frequency of submissions, most used words, emojis and specific r/wallstreetbets \"lingo\". Further, we look into the event itself gather information to answer out second research question. Then we proceed with analysing the sentiment using three main approaches on a varying spectrum of model customisability, from the most off-the-shelf with textBlob, to a Vader model updatd with specific \"lingo\", to a custom classifier trained with word embedding techniques. Finally, we gather our findings, evaluate them and conclude our research."

    "Here we define the methods to pull the Reddit submissions data from the Pushift API. The offical Reddit API is called PRAW, but we used Pushshift because it \"was designed and created by the /r/datasets mod team to help provide enhanced functionality and search capabilities for searching Reddit comments and submissions.\", for example, querying a specific time-range is not availale in PRAW, whilst Pushift provides this needed capability. \n",

This is because, with one single request, the CSV file would become too large and crash before saving, hence leaving us with nothing but a dead kernel o_o. Throught throttling, we were able to divide the workload in separate files, and if one time interval ended up containing too many submissions, we still had the data for the previous intervals saved and ready to go.\n",

We did not fetch the actual text of the submission because of the size of the body of text, and decided to proceed with NLP techniques solely on the titles. The fields we actually ended up using are only the author, title, and created_utc fields. A direction for future improvements is to perform a deeper analysis on the submission by looking at the scores and upward ratios and look for sentiment trends in these subgroups.\n"

    "The approach we used to conduct our analysis, while statistically rigorous and valid, has some areas of improvement and limitations.\n",
    "First, the correlation between submission sentiment and share price performance is not necessarily causally related. moreover, many events parallel to WSB's euphoria acted on the share price. For example, the block to the possibility of buying a stock was followed by a drop in the market. Also, when Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya had a huge increase in the share price. The extent to which these events affected the market is difficult to estimate, as they occurred at a time of extreme volatility. The tweets of the entrepreneurs occurred on the day when the biggest rise in the share price was already being recorded, while the restrictions on the purchase of shares occurred a few days after the peak. Since the effect of these events on the market cannot be eliminated, it is difficult to understand how much our model can actually predict the trend of the action, and how much it is actually a model that can predict only this one event.\n",
    "The events mentioned above are only two of the countless aspects that influence markets, since markets are the result of investors' expectations and a number of other events, both exogenous and endogenous.\n",
    "Finally, the time horizon that we have considered is limited and our analysis could be able to explain mainly the events occourred in the time we considered."
